 * The standard structure std::tm and the standard type std::time_t
 * are used to operate the RTC.
 * There is the class TM that is derived from std::tm that enhances
 * structure std::tm with some convenience functions for std::tm.
 *
 * The class RtcDueRcf_Alarm is used to operate the alarm features
 * of the RTC.

  /**
   * Set time zone.
   *
   * Example 1 using predefined time zone string (see bottom of this file.):
   *  RtcSam3X::clock.tzset(TZ::CET);
   *
   * Example 2 using custom time zone string:
   *  (refer to https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/tzset.3.html)
   *  RtcSam3XÂ´::clock.tzset("CT+6:00:00+5:00:00,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/3");
   *
   * Setting the time zone is required for the correct collaboration of
   * the standard C++ entities std::tm, std::time_t, mktime(), gmtime(),
   * gmtime_r(), localtime(), localtime_r() along with the this RtcDueRcf class.
   * It is also needed for determining the daylight savings (also referred
   * to as dst) begin and end.
   *
   * Note: When the time zone changes, the local time and the alarms
   * still operate local.
   *
   * E.g. The local time is 15:00h and there is an alarm set at 16:00h.
   * After the time zone has changed, the local time within the new time
   * zone is still 15:00h and the alarm time will still appear at 16:00h
   * within the new time zone.
   *
   * @param timezone Refer to https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/tzset.3.html
   *  for the explanation of the timezone string format.
   *
   * RTC alarms will be adjusted according to actual daylight savings
   * condition. That means that the RTC holds the local daylight saving
   * time during the daylight saving time period. It holds the
   * local standard time outside of the daylight savings period.
   * Hence the RTC will jump X hours forward when entering the
   * daylight savings period and X hours backward when leaving the daylight
   * savings condition. X is evaluated from the actual time zone information
   * (typically X is 1 hour.)
   * How to keep track of whether the RTC already jumped forward or
   * backward so that another jump woun't be applied upon a CPU reset?
   * This is done by using the 12-hrs mode of the RTC.
   * The decision was taken to let the RTC run in 12-hrs mode within the
   * daylight savings period and in the 24-hrs mode outside of it.
   *
   * Hence, the jump information isn't lost upon a CPU power fail, while
   * the RTC is powered by a backup battery.
   * There is also no problem reading a 24-hrs format from the RTC that
   * is running in a 12-hrs mode and vice versa, because it will be converted.
   * The same is valid for writing to the RTC.

   *    tm_isdst (the daylight savings flag) can be set to -1. Setting
   *    tm_isdst to -1 means, that daylight savings is unknown.
   *    The fields time.tm_wday will and time.tm_isdst be fixed before
   *    the  RTC is set by calling std::mktime() up front.
   *    This function uses the time zone information for

   *    when mktime() has to solve an ambiguity. This is when

   *    back from daylight savings to standard time. Typically that
   *    happens between 2:00h and 3:00h.

   *    the hour has been switched back). If you mean 2:30h at daylight
